# Drone

Hi all! Here you will find the source codes to do a basic drone. This is NOT yet finished, it only takes you to the point where motors can be controlled when physically wired to a voltage source and an Edison. Anyway it's a good starting point.


Hello out there.  Has there been any further development information, advice, or opinion since above post(2+yrs ago)?
